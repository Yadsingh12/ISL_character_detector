# ISL_character_detector
I made this project to make a live detection software that detects english characters as represented in Indian Sign language.

DATASET:
the dataset consists of various resources bundled together:
https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/7tsw22y96w/1
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumyakushwaha/indian-sign-language-dataset
https://github.com/ayeshatasnim-h/Indian-Sign-Language-dataset

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
Although the earlier versions (versions_1 and version_2) works well on the dataset(80 percent accuracy for version_1 and 90% accuracy for version_2 on validation dataset), yet they still do poorly on live detection.
